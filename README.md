# Frequency of Elements Using Arrays in C#

This is a C# console application that takes 8 integers from the user
and counts how many times each element appears in the array.

## 📌 Program Description
- The user enters 8 integer values
- Values are stored in an integer array
- The program checks each element
- Duplicate elements are handled correctly
- Frequency of each unique element is displayed

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Nested `for` loops
- Boolean flag logic
- Conditional statements
- Console input/output

## ▶ How the Program Works
1. An integer array of size 8 is created
2. The user inputs 8 numbers
3. The program loops through the array
4. For each element:
   - It checks whether the element was already processed
   - If not, it counts how many times it appears
   - Prints the frequency only once per element.
